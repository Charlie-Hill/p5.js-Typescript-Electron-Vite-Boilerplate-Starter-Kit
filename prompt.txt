Here's a detailed description and a simple ASCII representation of a **semi-cartoon, half-realistic top-down 2D game asset** for an **airliner** (inspired by a Airbus A380/Boeing 747 commercial jet). This can be used as a reference for pixel art, vector illustration, or sprite creation in tools like Aseprite, Photoshop, or Procreate. --- ### 🎨 **Art Style Guidelines** - **Semi-cartoon / Half-realistic**: Clean lines, subtle shading, minimal stylization, realistic proportions, but with bold outlines and slight exaggeration for readability at small sizes. - **Top-down view**: Symmetrical fuselage, wings visible, engines under wings, tail fin prominent. - **Color palette**: Airline livery (e.g., fictional "SkyLink Airlines") - Fuselage: Light silver-gray (#D3D8E0) with white top (#FFFFFF) - Windows: Dark blue tint (#1A2A44) - Engines: Metallic gray with red accents - Tail: White with blue swoosh logo - Wings: Silver with red winglets - **Size recommendation**: 256x256 px (scalable sprite) --- ### ✈️ **Top-Down Airliner Sprite (ASCII Art Reference)**
